# JavaScript Null Value Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript related to null value handling. The `bug.js` file contains a function that demonstrates how null values can cause unexpected behavior.

The solution is implemented in `bugSolution.js`. It addresses the issue by explicitly checking for null values before performing operations that might result in an error when null values are encountered. The solution handles the null values gracefully by returning appropriate values or throwing meaningful errors based on the context.  This prevents unexpected behavior and increases the robustness of the code.

This example highlights the importance of careful null value handling in JavaScript for robust and predictable code execution.
